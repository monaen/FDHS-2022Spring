    * **VOLUME**: the amount of data from myriad sources.
    * **VARIETY**: different types of data:
        - Multidomain: structure V.S. unstructure
        - Recurrent
        - Identify clinical questions
    * **VELOCITY**: the speed at which big data is generated.
    * **VERACITY**: the degree to which big data can be trusted.
    * **VALUE**: the business value of the data collected.
    * **VARIABILITY**: the ways in which the big data can be used and formatted.
* **Outcomes**:
  - Understand the framework of heterogeneous medical data.
  - Basic capabilities of organizing and integrating in consideration of both human and machineinterpretable.

### Course 3: Python Foundation 1

* **Instructor:** Dr. Nan Meng (Naen)

* **Introduction:** In this course, we will introduce a popular programming language --- [Python](https://www.python.org/), which is widely used in various fields such as medical image processing, optimization, data analysis and visualization, etc. This course consists of two parts. In the first part, we start by introducing the **merits and benefits** of this language for medical data processing and analysis. After that, we will recommend some popular integrated development environments (IDEs) for python, such as Anaconda (distribution), Pycharm, etc.
    Start from the second part, we will get our hands dirty. We will demonstrate how to install the Python environment and set out to work on some simple projects to figure out how the python works and master some basic rules of coding.

[comment]: # (Grace thinks this section may need to be 2 course)

* **Contents:**
    - Introduction of Python.
    - Introduction of commonly used packages in Python: Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, etc.
    - Coding tools: Anaconda & Pycharm & Notebook.
    - Operators and data type in Python.

    - Output formats in Python.
    - Practise with Python.

* **Outcomes:**
    - Be able to successfully install Python environment.
    - Know about the function of different python packages.
    - Master the basic coding rules when using Python.
    - Can do some simple calculations using Python language.
    - Understand different printing formats and can control the formats of printing results.

### Course 4: Python Foundation 2

* **Instructor:** Dr. Nan Meng (Naen)

* **Introduction:** In this course, we will follow what we have learned in the last course and continue to learn the logic flow and functions in Python. This course is a laboratory course in which we will learn new concepts and coding simultaneously. We will demonstrate how to control the logic flow in python, how to define and execute functions, and display/visualize image data in this course.
